## Goals

1. To produce a fully working landing page with the required feature, for every
screen size required
2. To implement all the extra suggested feature:
  - Active state to navigation list items
  - Hide navigation when scrolling the page
  - Add scroll to top button after going past fold of page
  - Make sections collapsible
  - Update the design
3. To write code as efficiently as I can
4. To gain better understanding of JavaScript

## Challenges

- Finding the best way to represent the and build the collapse symbols, either
image tag, span tag, background image
- Took a few goes at understanding where I can use ES6 arrow functions, still
not completely sure I have used them to the full extent?
- finding an issue with the nav click -> scroll to section, where it didn't
fully scroll for middle sections by one pixel. Only in chrome for mobile. Which
resulted in a small 'hack' to resolve.

## Notes-for-reviewer

If you could pay particular attention to the `js/app.js` file and recommend any
better ways of doing things, e.g. written and ordering the function, for loops
etc.
